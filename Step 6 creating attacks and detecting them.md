<h1>Creating attacks and Detecting them<h/1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we are going to steal credentials on a system and detect them.
<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>VMware Fusion</b>
- <b>Linux Server 22.04.2</b>
- <b>Windows 11</b>
- <b>Lima Charlie</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<!-- <p align="center"> --!>
1 - On your ssh client run > getprivs (to make sure the SeDebugPrivilege is available) then run > procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp (here we are going to steal credentials on a system). <br/>
2 - This will dump the remote process from memory, and save it locally on your Sliver C2 server. (if you see a RPC error donâ€™t worry and continue on). <br/>

<br />
3	- Let's detect the attack by opening Lima Charlie on the web browser and choose sensors from the left side > then your hostname > timeline from the left side > and in the Event Type Filters filter for SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS <br/>

<br />
4	- Pick any event to see what the event looks like when credential access has occurred. Then select Build D&R Rule to create a rule that alerts us anytime this activity occurs. <br/>

<br />
5 - In the Detect section replace the whole contents with this > event: SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS op: ends with path: event/*/TARGET/FILE_PATH value: lsass.exe (this means to detect only SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS events where the victim or target process ends with lsass.exe). <br/>
6 - In the Respond section replace the whole contents with this > - action: report name: LSASS access (this will simply generate a detection report anytime this detection occurs in Lima Charlie). <br/>
7 - Then select Target Event at the bottom. <br/>

<br />
8 - Scroll all the way down and select Test Event. You can see that a Match and the D&R engine tells you exactly what it matched on. <br/>

<br />
9 - Scroll all the way up and select Save Rule. <br/>

<br />
10 - Name it LSASS Accessed and make sure it is enabled. <br/>

<br />
11 - Let's create another attack so Lima Charlie detects the rule we just created. Back in the ssh client run > procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp <br/>
<img width="900" alt="8" src="https://github.com/A0005/SOC-Analyst-Lab/assets/103763124/5df0c867-fe21-40cc-bc5d-04958f14cbe1">
<br />
12 - Back on Lima Charlie select the Deceptions tab to see the threats that have been detected. <br/>

<br />
13 - Select one of the events to see the raw details that have occurred. <br>

<br />
14 - To see the exact timeline where the detection took place select View Event Timeline. <br/>
